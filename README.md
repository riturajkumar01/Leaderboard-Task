Hey, I have a zip file project setup for a Leaderboard App but it's currently not working properly.Please help me complete and fix the project fully with the following requirements:✅ Goal: A fully working full-stack leaderboard app✅ Project Type: Next.js + TailwindCSS + TypeScript + MongoDB (I assume)🧩 What I need you to complete or fix:1. User List Display: - Show existing 10 users on the homepage. - Create functionality to add a new user from frontend. - Save new user in the database.2. Claim Points Feature: - Beside each user, there should be a “Claim” button. - On click, assign random points between 1 to 10 to that user. - Update that user’s total points in the database.3. Leaderboard Section: - Show ranked list of users (by total points). - Display: Rank | Name | Points - Leaderboard should update automatically after every point claim (either real-time or periodic polling).4. Claim History Collection: - For each point claim, store a record in a separate history collection (with user ID, points, timestamp). - Optionally, show this history in a table on a separate page or section.5. Backend API: - Ensure RESTful or API routes (in Next.js) handle: - GET all users - POST new user - POST claim points (random) - GET leaderboard - GET claim history6. Make the Whole App Functional: - Ensure all buttons, inputs, data fetches, and updates are working properly. - Handle edge cases like no user selected, same user claiming multiple times, etc.7. UI Completion: - UI should be clean, basic and responsive. - Use TailwindCSS for styling (it’s already present). - No need for fancy animations, just neat layout.8. Deployment-Ready: - The project should be deployable on Vercel (Next.js compatible). - If any MongoDB connection or environment variable setup is missing, add .env.example.🚨 Final Deliverables:- Working frontend (Next.js)- Functional backend API (or Next.js API routes)- MongoDB database integration- All features working as per spec- Responsive and clean UIThanks a lot! Please let me know once it's complete and if anything else is needed from my side.

I'll help you create a complete, fully functional leaderboard app with all the features you requested! Let me build this from scratch with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and MongoDB integration.
